# Ask Bosco VP Engineering Assessment
## Redesigned for 2025+: AI-Era Leadership Evaluation

Welcome to the Ask Bosco VP Engineering technical assessment. This assessment is designed to evaluate your ability to **lead engineering teams in an AI-assisted world** - testing judgment, validation skills, and leadership rather than coding from scratch.

## Overview

Ask Bosco is building an AI-powered marketing analytics platform that ingests data from 100+ sources (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, GA4, Shopify, etc.), combines them with AI for better analytics, and delivers actionable insights to marketing agencies and eCommerce retailers.

The platform is built on Python and hosted on Google Cloud, using modern data stack tools for ingestion, transformation, and analytics.

## Our Philosophy: Why This Assessment Is Different

**Traditional assessment (2023):**
> "Can you code without AI?"

**Our assessment (2025+):**
> "Can you lead engineers, validate AI output, and make judgment calls that AI cannot?"

### What We Actually Believe:
- ✅ You SHOULD use AI tools (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- ✅ We're evaluating your **judgment**, not your typing speed
- ✅ VP Engineering needs to **validate AI** and **lead humans**, not write everything from scratch
- ✅ The future VP must know **when to use AI** and **when not to**

## Assessment Structure

This assessment consists of four tasks, each designed to evaluate AI-era leadership skills:

1. **AI-Assisted Code Review** (30 minutes)
   - Use AI to help review code, then critique AI's suggestions
   - See [tasks/task1-code-review.md](tasks/task1-code-review.md) for details

2. **AI-Assisted System Design** (30 minutes)
   - Have AI generate architecture, then improve it with business context
   - See [tasks/task2-system-design.md](tasks/task2-system-design.md) for details

3. **Engineering Leadership: AI-Era Team Dynamics** (20 minutes)
   - Handle competing priorities including AI adoption challenges
   - See [tasks/task3-leadership.md](tasks/task3-leadership.md) for details

4. **AI Output Validation** (30 minutes)
   - Review AI-generated code with intentional bugs and critique it
   - See [tasks/task4-coding.md](tasks/task4-coding.md) for details

## Instructions

1. **IMPORTANT: You are EXPECTED and ENCOURAGED to use AI tools** (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
2. This assessment is designed to take approximately 2 hours for take-home portion + 30-45 minutes for live discussion
3. **Document which AI tools you used and how** - this shows good practice
4. For system design, use any tool you prefer (AI-generated diagrams are fine!)
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run tests: `pytest src/tests/`
7. **What we're evaluating:**
   - Can you critically evaluate AI suggestions?
   - Can you catch bugs AI introduces or misses?
   - Can you add business context AI doesn't have?
   - Can you lead humans in ways AI cannot?

## Evaluation Criteria (AI-Era Skills)

We will evaluate your submission based on:

1. **AI Tool Proficiency** (15%)
   - Can you use AI effectively to multiply your productivity?
   - Do you document AI usage transparently?
   - Do you choose the right AI tool for the task?

2. **Critical Validation** (25%)
   - Can you catch AI mistakes and subtle bugs?
   - Do you identify issues AI missed completely?
   - Can you explain WHY AI suggestions are wrong?
   - Do you understand code deeply enough to critique AI?

3. **Judgment & Prioritization** (20%)
   - Can you choose between multiple AI-generated options?
   - Do you add business context AI doesn't have?
   - Can you make strategic calls AI cannot?
   - Do you know when NOT to use AI?

4. **Real-Time Leadership** (20%)
   - Can you handle crisis situations without AI assistance?
   - Can you manage people issues with empathy?
   - Can you make quick decisions under pressure?
   - Can you communicate effectively with stakeholders?

5. **Strategic Thinking** (15%)
   - Can you see beyond what AI suggests?
   - Do you consider team, cost, and business constraints?
   - Can you architect systems for AI-assisted teams?
   - Do you build processes to prevent future issues?

6. **Communication** (5%)
   - Can you explain technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders?
   - Do you document your reasoning clearly?
   - Can you mentor others on AI usage?

## Business Context

- **Markets:** Marketing & eCommerce Agencies, eCommerce retailers
- **Team Structure:** 2 data engineers, 1 data scientist, 2 full-stack developers
- **Scale:** 100+ data sources, thousands of clients, billions of rows of data
- **Key Challenges:** Data quality, pipeline performance, cost optimization, rapid feature delivery
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Google Cloud Platform, modern data engineering tools

## Philosophy of This Assessment

This assessment focuses on **AI-era leadership skills**, not pre-AI coding ability. We assume:
- ✅ You will use AI tools extensively (we encourage it!)
- ✅ You can critically evaluate and validate AI output
- ✅ You add judgment and context AI cannot provide
- ✅ You understand when to use AI vs. when to rely on human judgment
- ❌ We do NOT test "can you code without AI" (that's obsolete)
- ❌ We do NOT penalize AI usage (we expect it)
- ❌ This is NOT a senior developer role - VP leadership matters most

### What Makes a Great VP Engineering in 2025+:
**NOT THIS:**
- Best coder who writes everything themselves
- Memorizes syntax and patterns
- Works without AI tools

**BUT THIS:**
- Best validator who catches subtle AI mistakes
- Leads teams using AI to 10x productivity
- Makes judgment calls AI cannot
- Handles people issues with empathy
- Knows when AI helps vs. when it doesn't

## Submission

Please complete as many of the tasks as you can within the allotted time. If you cannot complete all tasks, prioritize based on what you believe would provide the most value and demonstrate your strengths as a VP Engineering candidate.

Good luck! We're excited to see your approach to these challenges.
